# Land-Registry-Data
Adds haders to Prices Paid dataset from Land Registry and extracts the Greater London Area.


The Prices Paid dataset can be downloaded directly from the Land Registry website, in bulk form and without headers. This Python file adds headers to the file, organises in sequence, and to this case converts property type, new build, duration, and category columns to numeric form.

Details about the dataset can be found at:

https://www.gov.uk/guidance/about-the-price-paid-data#download-options

The file contains housing transactions from 1995 to the latest date.
